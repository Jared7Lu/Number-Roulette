A game of PG Russian Roulette with Numbers.

Inspiration
    The inspiration for this game was Russian Roulette. My little brother and I, got bored one day and where trying to make a game and we ended playing Russian Roulette with numbers. It was a game that was reliant on memory and trust. 

How To Play?
    The first thing us for both players to chose the number in which is essentially where the bullet is. 

    The first player then choses a number on the player's 2 side, and if it is the number that player 2 chose in the begining, then player 1 loses, if not then it's player 2 turn, untill either player loses or a draw is reached.

Technologies used!
    -Vs code
    -Google images

Bugs?!?
    One nnfinished functionality is images appearing in the center of the screen to show whos turn it is and wether they win or lose.
